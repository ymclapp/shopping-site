        <h2>Time to get ahead on your fitness goals</h2> 
        <p>
            We have a created a page where you can compare workouts by Beachbody, select which ones you would like to do, "buy" them, and they will be arranged into a hybrid calendar for you.  That calendar will have interactive links that you can click on to go to the workout for that day, enter your calories burned, and rate the workout.
